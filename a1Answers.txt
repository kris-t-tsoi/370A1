Q1.
In order for messages not to be interleaved when mulitple processors are using 
the same named pipe is to ensure that there is only one process that is writing to
the named piped and one process that is receieving from the pipe. This results in
the named pipe acting as a queue so the first data item that was passed in is 
the first data item to be removed out of the named pipe


Q2.
The buffer_space list in the buffer class do not need to be protected by a lock as
only a single processor is appending to and popping values from the buffer_space 
list, therefore there is no need to worry about duplicate or missing values in the
list due to multiple processors trying to change the list at the same time.


Q3.
A security issue involving using the process id as the message passing identifier 
is that the system does not generate truely random the process id numbers.
This means that malicious users could easily figure out the process id number and 
use the process id to gain access to the messages being passed, this puts the 
integrity of the data being passed at risk.
